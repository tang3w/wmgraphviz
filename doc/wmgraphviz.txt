REQUIREMENTS                                         *wmgraphviz-requirements*

This plugin expects Graphviz dot (http://www.graphviz.org/) to be installed in
the path. If dot is installed, but not found an explicit path can be given
by means of the |g:WMGraphviz_dot| setting.

OMNICOMPLETION                                     *wmgraphviz-omnicompletion*

The plugin supports Vim omnicompletion (<C-X><X-O>) for attributes of nodes,
edges and the graph and for the values for some of these attributes (e.g.,
shapes, styles, fonts, colors, and more).

For example, >
	node[sh<C-X><C-O>
completes to >
	node[shape=
And, >
	node[shape=pl<C-X><C-O>
completes to >
	node[shape=plaintext
